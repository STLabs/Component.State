///  A storable with version and migration
///  useful for domain entities.
///
///  Models are storable so collections of them can be
///  written and read to json and plist files, converted
///  formatted to `Strings`, or `Data`. 
///  They have methods to support migration and versioning.
/// 
///  Migration
///  ==========
///  To support migration:
/// 
///  * implement `static func writeVersion(with: Store)`
/// 
///    this method should be called in the `store(to:)` method
///    before writing to a store is finished to give the model an
///    opportunity to write version information to the store.
/// 
///  * implement `static func migrate(from: Store) -> Store`
/// 
///    this method should be called in the `restore(from:)` method
///    before reading any values from the store to give the model
///    an opportunity to migrate the store. Here the model should:
/// 
///    -  read the version information from the store
///    -  compare the version information with the "current version"
///    -  add, remove, and update keys, and values to the store
///    -  return the updated store.
/// 
///    In the `restore(from:)` method use the migrated store to read
///    and instantiate the model instance.
public protocol Model: Storable {
    
    /// Finish reading from a store.
    ///
    /// Optionally call this method after restoring from the store
    /// in the `restore(from:) method if the model
    /// needs read extra key, value pairs from the store 
    /// before instantiation.
    func finishReading(from: Store)
    /// Finish writing to a store.
    ///
    /// Optionally call this method after storing 
    /// a model to a store in the `store(to:)` method 
    /// if the model need to store addional key, value
    /// pairs to the store.
    func finishWriting(to: inout Store)
    /// Writes the model version to the store.
    /// 
    /// Optionally call this method after storing a model 
    /// in the `store(to:)` method to write version 
    /// information to the store for migration purposes.
    static func writeVersion(to: inout Store)
    /// Migrates a store to the current version if needed.
    /// 
    /// Optionally call this method before restoring a model
    /// in the `restore(from:)` method to migrate the model
    /// before restoring. Use previously stored version information
    /// to determine if migration is nessesarry.
    ///
    /// In this method you can add, remove, or update properties
    /// in the store as needed to update the model prior to
    /// restoring.
