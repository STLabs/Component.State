///
/// Models read and write themselves to a `Store`

/// MIGRATION SUPPORT:
///
/// Migration is an opt-in feature, by default
/// models will not participate in migration.
///
/// To support migration:
///
///  * implement `static func writeVersion(with: Store)`
///
///     this function should be called in the `write(to:)` method
///     before writing to a store is finished to give models an 
///     opertunity to write version information to the store.
///
/// * implement `static func migrateIfNeeded(with: Store) -> Store`
///
///     this function should be called in the `read(from:)` method
///     before reading to give the model an opertunity to migrate
///     the model to the current version. Here the model should:
///
///    -  read the version information from the store
///    -  compare the version information with the "current version"
///    -  add, remove, and update keys, and values as needed migrate
///    -  return the updated store. 
///    
///   in the `read(from:)` method use the migrated store to read
///   and instantiate the model instance.
